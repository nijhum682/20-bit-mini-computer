Excited to share my 2207111 Tiny 20-bit Computer designed and simulated in Logisim. The system includes all core components such as the Program Counter (PC), Memory Address Register (MAR), Memory Buffer Register (MBR), Instruction Register (IR), Accumulator (AC), RAM, Fetch Flip-Flop, and a 20-bit ALU with Booth’s Multiplier. The ALU supports arithmetic and logic operations including ADD, AND, XOR, NOR, SHIFT, COMPLEMENT, along with branching and memory instructions, all executed through a proper fetch–decode–execute cycle controlled by a dedicated Control Unit.
The design also clearly defines the instruction format and opcodes, as shown on the right side of the diagram, mapping binary instruction codes to operations such as AND, ADD, STO, ISZ, BSB, BUN, HLT, LOAD, SHR, XOR, SPA, NOR, and CME. This project strengthened my understanding of computer architecture, instruction set design, and hardware-level data flow. 💻✨
